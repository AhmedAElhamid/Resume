    "bio":"I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for software developing, and a passion for coding. After working as a Network Engineer, I started feeling my passion for software developing when faced with very limited time and a lot of routine work so I started researching for ways to help myself and my team to be more productive and developed a software to automate a lot of the manual work we have been doing. Then I decided to quit my job to purse my passion to be a software developer and started learning web developing while working as a freelancer on a project for premium ranks, Australia. in April 2021 I finished studying web developing using MERN technologies and still work as a freelancer in upwork while pursuing my ideas and working on projects of my own.",
